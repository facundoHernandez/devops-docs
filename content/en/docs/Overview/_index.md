## What is it?

**This is all we need, a centralized documentation service based on "Docs as Code"**

## Why do we need it?

### Documentation is everything, if it's not documented don't exist.


Some benefits of an efficient documentation:

* **A single source of truth saves time and energy**: 
  
  Estimates state that the average knowledge worker spends about two and a half hours per day searching for the information they need. Effective documentation collects all of the must-know information about a task, project, or team (from account logins to step-by-step instructions) in a centralized, organized place. No more digging through email or downloaded files for the latest information.

* **Documentation is essential to quality and process control**: 

  There’s more than one way to get things done, and you want to give your team the flexibility to approach their work in a way that suits them best. 
  But, at the same time, you want to ensure consistent results – especially when it comes to things that you’re producing on a regular basis. There needs to be some level of cohesion so that you don’t look sloppy or uninformed. 
  
  **Documentation encourages knowledge sharing, which empowers your team to understand how processes work and what finished projects typically look like.**

* **Documentation cuts down duplicative work**: 
  
  How many times have you started a new project only to find out it had been done before? Companies that use documentation to catalog past projects, collect research, and share decisions benefit by reducing re-work that wastes precious time you could be using elsewhere. 
  Why reinvent the wheel when you can just build on the work that’s already happened? With documentation in place, you can refer to past work and learn from it, instead of doing it all over again with the same results.
